# OMDB Express Application

The intention of this app was to connect to [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com), a public movie API, and use that information for users to search and store movies in a favs list.

## Getting Started

-   Fork and clone this repository, which has a starter app provided for you.
-   Run `npm install` to install dependencies
-   Read the API [documentation](http://www.omdbapi.com).

# Part 1: Search

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to go to a home page to search a database full of movies.
2. As a user, I want to see movie results based on my search query.
3. As a user, I want to pick a movie result and see detailed information about the movie.
4. As a user, I want to save movies from my search results to a list of my faves.
5. As a user, I want to perform this action from the movie detail page.

## Process Work

1. Create a form on the homepage that takes a movie title for the input value.
2. Write your GET route for the return of the search.
3. Turn the returns into links using their ids and create a GET route for a details page.
